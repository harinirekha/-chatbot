# -chatbot
This is  a basic design for an academic chatbot in Python. This chatbot will provide information about academic-related queries such as exam schedules, class timings, syllabus, etc.his is a simple rule-based chatbot where we define a dictionary of responses for different academic queries. When the user inputs a question or query, the chatbot searches for keywords in the input and responds accordingly. If no relevant keyword is found, it provides a default response.
You can expand the responses dictionary with more queries and responses based on your requirements.
